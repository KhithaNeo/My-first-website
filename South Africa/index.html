  <h1>South Africa</h1>
  <p>In this website I will tell you a little bit more about South Africa, the country that I come from.
    South Africa is located in the south of the continent (hence the name). Many often mistaken it for the region Southern Africa,
    when it is in fact its own separate, sovereign state. I suppose the confusion is understandable which is why every other year
    petitions to have the name of the country changed spring up. So far none of these proposals have really  taken hold so it is likely
    that the country will continue to be called South Africa well into the foreseeable future.</p>
